**EID / PID**
Session EID / probe ID and path, e.g. 
- 09156021-9a1d-4e1d-ae59-48cbde3c5d42 hausserlab/PL015/2022-02-22/001
(it can be a list if you have multiple failures)

**What task has failed, with what error message**
e.g. EphysSynchPulses failed for all the above sessions with error `gnagna` and I do not know what I can do about it, please advise.

**Background on the recording**
Is this session a dud ? Is it worth trying to extract it? Has anything unusual happened during recording?
